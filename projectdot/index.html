			<h1>suggestion one: use inclusive language</h1>
				<p>Society has been made to believe that only women menstruate and their reproductive organs are what determine one’s gender; however, that is not the case. In fact, not all women menstruate, and not everyone who menstruates is a woman. When coupled with the fact that <strong>transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary (TGNC/NB) people</strong>, especially Black and Brown people, are disproportionately affected by poverty, it becomes even more important to be inclusive and let them know that help is available (<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/period-poverty-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-people" target="_blank" class="citation">Roark, 2019</a>). </p>

				<p>According to the ACLU, menstrual products are not uniformly available in bathrooms and homeless shelters (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbt-rights/menstruation-related-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination-we-dont-need-to-erase-trans-or-non-binary-people-to-make-that-point/" target="_blank" class="citation">Arkles & Weis-Wolf, 2019</a>). Limited access negatively affects TGNC/NB people especially, so missions for menstrual access and equity should be made open to them.</p>

				<p>Project Dot’s “About us” page states that the mission is to supply feminine hygiene products to “homeless and low income girls, women, binary and transmen,” but <strong>the terminology is incorrect and not present throughout the site.</strong> Most of the site mentions “girls,” “women,” and “feminine hygiene,” and that can read as exclusionary to TGNC/NB people who are interested to learn more, help, or even receive help.</p>

				<p>As an organization that works to raise awareness and support for hygiene needs in homeless and low income communities, Project Dot should implement more inclusive language. More inclusive language indicates <strong>support for marginalised communities,</strong> and it provides the opportunity to <strong>reach and help more people.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Don’t use:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Girls</li>
					<li>Women</li>
					<li>Feminine hygiene</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Think about using:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>People who menstruate</li>
					<li>Menstrual hygiene</li>
					<ul class="sub">
						<li>Personal hygiene with a focus on menstrual hygiene/menstruation/periods</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Specifically mention transgender, gender non-conforming, and nonbinary (TGNC/NB) people</li>
				</ul>

			<h1>suggestion two: social media</h1>
				<p>Social media is a huge part for any organisation that allows them to reach so many different people for little to nothing. It can help <strong>“engage supporters, capturing and retaining their attention,”</strong> and can <strong>increase awareness</strong> for the organisation (<a href="https://www.missionbox.com/article/118/why-social-media-matters-to-nonprofits" target="_blank" class="citation">MissionBox, 2020</a>). However, social media should be taken seriously and integrated with the marketing plan for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

				<p>According to MissionBox, a communication hub for nonprofits, a survey conducted among more than 9,000 small to medium-size nonprofits in the United States and Canada showed that Facebook is a primary social network for them, with Twitter next and other platforms like YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Instagram following behind (<a href="https://www.missionbox.com/article/118/why-social-media-matters-to-nonprofits" target="_blank" class="citation">MissionBox, 2020</a>). Social media can <strong>boost messages and establish relationships</strong> with partners to grow the organisation. Analytics can also inform you more about the audience you are reaching and make posts far more effective. In fact, for nonprofits, social media is growing 3x faster than email and should be used to announce what is happening and what is coming (<a href="https://buffer.com/library/social-media-non-profits/" target="_blank" class="citation">Lee</a>).</p>

				<p>Buffer has a <a href="https://buffer.com/library/social-media-non-profits/" target="_blank" class="citation">guide</a> for nonprofits looking to up their social media game, and it should be considered to see what works best for you!</p>

				<p>Project Dot should consider expanding the breadth of social media being used and make sure the accounts are linked to the main website. That way, all platforms are consolidated into one area and make it easier for anyone interested to access them.</p>

				<h2>Instagram</h2>
					<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Instagram</a> would be a great platform to expand into. Wild Apricot, a site filled with resources for nonprofits, has a guide for using Instagram as a nonprofit that includes tips like making a business account (labeled as a nonprofit) and connecting your Instagram and Facebook accounts (<a href="https://www.wildapricot.com/blogs/newsblog/2019/09/17/instagram-for-nonprofits" target="_blank" class="citation">Morand, 2019</a>). Instagram is a great opportunity to post educational graphics, to educate followers and appeal to visual learners, and progress pictures, to let people know how you are doing and what you are doing. This allows you to connect with the community and reach a younger audience.</p>

					<div id="ig_photos">
						<img class="square_img" src="new_assets/media/ig_info.jpg" alt="info about ig professional accounts" draggable="false">

						<img class="square_img" src="new_assets/media/ig_steps.jpg" alt="info about ig professional accounts" draggable="false">
					
						<p class="caption">Professional account benefits and how to switch to a professional account</p>
					</div>

					<p>Instagram has the option to make your account a professional one. From there, it can be labeled as a 'Nonprofit,' and it provides insight to help grow the account.</p>

					<p>Personal photos are amazing, but <strong>here are other resources for photo editing:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Canva</a> — good for editing and can be used on desktop or mobile devices</li>
						<li><a href="https://stocksnap.io/" target="_blank" class="citation">StockSnap</a> — free stock photography</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Pexels</a> — free stock photography</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Twitter</h2>
					<p><a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Twitter</a> would also be a great platform for interacting with audiences. It does not hurt to have different platforms to reach different audiences, and Twitter can be good for having conversations within the community and learning from others.</p> 

				<h2>TikTok</h2>
					<p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/" target="_blank" class="citation">TikTok</a> can potentially be another platform for interacting with younger audiences. Although a late comer to the game, it has become one of the fastest growing platforms for teenagers. In 2019, 2% of U.S. teenagers aged 13-17 said TikTok is their most used social app (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-marketing-trends-predictions-2020" target="_blank" class="citation">Meola, 2019</a>). The advantage of TikTok is its ease to use. The content consists of 15~60 sec short videos. Content shooting and editing can easily be done over the phone as well. The disadvantage of TikTok is its policy on censorship and user privacy concerns. Many older generations have a rather negative attitude towards the app and may stop their kids from using it.</p> 

					<p>Despite the stigma surrounding the platform, TikTok can be used to cultivate relationships with younger audiences and spread awareness of the organisation’s campaign and message. It might be worth looking into.</p>

				<h2>Platform Management</h2>
					<p>However, with multiple platforms, social media scheduling is another aspect that should be considered. It allows people to be “active” online without actually being online, and you can bulk produce content and schedule them out to make it more convenient for your schedule (<a href="https://www.ignitesearch.com.au/social-media-scheduling-the-benefits-of-social-media-scheduling-and-why-you-should-start-scheduling-today/" target="_blank" class="citation">Barley, 2018</a>). Additionally, it allows you to manage different accounts.</p> 

					<p>Each platform depends on your taste, but <strong>try considering:</strong><p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Buffer</a> — free basic plan but offers plans with more benefits like more accounts and more scheduled posts, pricing info <a href="https://buffer.com/pricing/publish" target="_blank" class="citation">here</a></li>

			<h1>suggestion three: include resources alongside the motivational message</h1>
				<p>According to a Homeless Hub blog post, a blog run by the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness (COH), it is important to <strong>leverage existing campaigns and resources</strong> to <strong>increase awareness</strong> (<a href="https://www.homelesshub.ca/blog/how-raise-awareness-about-hidden-homelessness" target="_blank" class="citation">Woolley, 2015</a>). Motivational messages can be helpful, but coupling them with resources can make the card even more effective for recipients.</p>

				<p>The 3x4 inch card could either be expanded to include more information, or the resources can be placed on the back. While some resources may be a given, it can be important to have them typed out for people to reference whenever they need to.</p>

				<p>Some of the resources that can be included are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>General resources</li>
					<li>Homelessness resources</li>
					<li>LGBTQ+ resources</li>
					<li>Mental health resources</li>
					<li>School resources</li>
				</ul>

				<p>There is a comprehensive list divided into different categories available on <a href="https://helphopehome.org/get-help/" target="_blank" class="citation">Help Hope Home</a>, an organisation aiming to end homelessness in Southern Nevada. There is also a list of resources from them available in a brochure format <a href="http://helphopehome.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Homeless-Resource-Guide-7.10.18.pdf" target="_blank" class="citation">here</a>. While this is an extensive list, one of each of the mentioned categories above would be beneficial for any recipient of the Project Dot kit.</p>

			<h1>suggestion four: logo</h1>
				<p>Logos are a part of brand identity and important to the overall perception of the organisation. It seems relatively simple and something you can create on your own or with free software, but logos are representative of your brand and something that should have a lot of thought put into. Having your logo designed by a graphic designer has a number of benefits, such as saving time and money (especially in the long run), helping you stand out amongst other organisations, and keeping your branding consistent (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-reasons-you-should-hire-professional-graphic-designer-rob-garza" target="_blank" class="citation">Garza, 2015</a>). Overall, having a professionally created logo is more helpful than not.</p>

				<p>The current Project Dot logo is simple and to the point, but if desired, hiring a graphic designer can elevate the logo and help establish a more concrete brand identity. Working with a graphic designer allows you to establish a relationship where they know your wants and needs and can specifically create a tailored design. If it is a local designer, it helps create connections within the community. Free logo makers are available, but having a graphic designer ensures that the design will be unique and catered to the brand. Additionally, this is an opportunity to establish design elements for the entire organisation that can be carried on into the future.</p>

				<p>Try looking at different local agencies’ portfolios to see if any of their work connects with what Project Dot stands for. There is also the option of looking for freelance graphic designers to commission and work with.</p> 

				<p>Logos may seem simple and unassuming, but crafting a logo that is visually appealing and effective is an art and a practice that should be recognised and valued as such.</p>

			<h1>suggestion six: website</h1>

			<h1>suggestion seven: donations</h1>
				<p>Donations are a pivotal part of any nonprofit organisation. However, it is not just about receiving donations but also donor cultivation. Donor cultivation is about engaging donors and learning about their feelings and perspectives on the organisation to encourage repeat donations (<a href="https://www.nonprofitpro.com/post/donor-cultivation-is-key-to-success/#:~:text=According%20to%20GiveGab%2C%20%E2%80%9CHow%20to,retaining%20and%20ensuring%20future%20donations." target="_blank" class="citation-dark">Haddad, 2018</a>). By communicating and engaging with donors, organisations are able to establish relationships that can be long lasting in supporting the cause.</p>

				<h2>PayPal</h2>

					<img src="new_assets/media/paypal.jpg" alt="paypal logo" draggable="false" id="paypal">
					<p class="caption">PayPal logo</p>

					<p>Project Dot currently uses <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">PayPal</a> which is great for receiving donations directly on the platform. They charge 0% platform fees and 2.2% + $0.30 transaction fees for nonprofits with 501(c)(3) status and 2.9% + $0.30 for organisations without this status. More information is available <a href="https://www.paypal.com/charities/" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">here.</a></p> 

					<p>However, PayPal does not really target donors and establish relationships with them.</p>

				<h2>DonorBox</h2>

					<img src="new_assets/media/donorbox.jpg" alt="donorbox logo" draggable="false">
					<p class="caption">DonorBox logo and example</p>

					<p><a href="https://donorbox.org/" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">DonorBox</a> is an online donation tool that integrates donation forms into the website. They allow for social media integration and have other integrations like Company Gift Matching (for $40/month) and email marketing with Mail Chimp (for $8/month). It has a platform fee of 1.5% along with additional processing fees depending on what donors use to pay:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>0.8% + $0.30 per transaction for ACH bank payments (capped at a maximum of $5 per transaction)</li>
						<li>2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for PayPal payments</li>
						<ul class="sub">
							<li>2.2% + $0.30 if the organisation has 501(c)(3) status</li>
						</ul>
						<li>2.9% and $0.30 per transaction for Stripe payments</li>
						<ul class="sub">
							<li>Discounted rates available for nonprofits. More information <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/fee-discount-for-nonprofit-organizations" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">here.</a></li>
						</ul>
					</ul>

					<p>While PayPal is perfectly acceptable, Donorbox offers additional features that should be considered. Some of them include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Monthly, Annual, Weekly and Quarterly Recurring Donations</li>
						<li>Donors Cover Fees</li>
						<li>Collect Address, Phone, Employment</li>
						<li>Custom Donation Page</li>
						<li>Tax Receipt</li>
					</ul>

					<p>View a comparison of DonorBox vs. Paypal <a href="https://donorbox.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020559551-Donorbox-vs-PayPal-Which-Is-Better-Optimized-For-Fundraising-" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">here.</a></p>

				<p>Donations are an important part of funding nonprofits, and it should be given the same amount of consideration as the website and other marketing tools.</p>
