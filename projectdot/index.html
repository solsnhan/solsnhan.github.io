			<h1>suggestion one: use inclusive language</h1>
				<p>Society has been made to believe that only women menstruate and their reproductive organs are what determine one’s gender; however, that is not the case. In fact, not all women menstruate, and not everyone who menstruates is a woman. When coupled with the fact that <strong>transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary (TGNC/NB) people</strong>, especially Black and Brown people, are disproportionately affected by poverty, it becomes even more important to be inclusive and let them know that help is available (<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/period-poverty-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-people" target="_blank" class="citation">Roark, 2019</a>). </p>

				<p>According to the ACLU, menstrual products are not uniformly available in bathrooms and homeless shelters (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbt-rights/menstruation-related-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination-we-dont-need-to-erase-trans-or-non-binary-people-to-make-that-point/" target="_blank" class="citation">Arkles & Weis-Wolf, 2019</a>). Limited access negatively affects TGNC/NB people especially, so missions for menstrual access and equity should be made open to them.</p>

				<p><strong><a href="https://helloclue.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Clue</a></strong>, a period and ovulation tracker app, uses gender neutral language throughout their app and uses their platform, both through their blog and social media, to help educate users about the importance of using gender neutral language when talking about periods. They state that <strong>people who do not fit under the common definition of “women”</strong> are often <strong>“easily isolated, marginalised, stigmatised, and discriminated against”</strong> (<a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/cycle-a-z/talking-about-periods-beyond-gender" target="_blank" class="citation">Bell, 2017</a>). Their blog post, <a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/cycle-a-z/talking-about-periods-beyond-gender" target="_blank" class="citation">“Talking about periods beyond gender,”</a> is a great place to start to familiarise yourself with the issue.</p>

				<p>Project Dot’s “About us” page states that the mission is to supply feminine hygiene products to “homeless and low income girls, women, binary and transmen,” but <strong>the terminology is incorrect and not present throughout the site.</strong> Most of the site mentions “girls,” “women,” and “feminine hygiene,” and that can read as exclusionary to TGNC/NB people who are interested to learn more, help, or even receive help.</p>

				<p>As an organization that works to raise awareness and support for hygiene needs in homeless and low income communities, Project Dot should implement more inclusive language. More inclusive language indicates <strong>support for marginalised communities,</strong> and it provides the opportunity to <strong>reach and help more people.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Don’t use:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Girls</li>
					<li>Women</li>
					<li>Feminine hygiene</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Think about using:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>People who menstruate</li>
					<li>Menstrual hygiene</li>
					<ul class="sub">
						<li>Personal hygiene with a focus on menstrual hygiene/menstruation/periods</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Specifically mention transgender, gender non-conforming, and nonbinary (TGNC/NB) people</li>
				</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="suggestions" id="two">
			<h1>suggestion two: include resources alongside the motivational message</h1>
				<p>According to a Homeless Hub blog post, a blog run by the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness (COH), it is important to <strong>leverage existing campaigns and resources</strong> to <strong>increase awareness</strong> (<a href="https://www.homelesshub.ca/blog/how-raise-awareness-about-hidden-homelessness" target="_blank" class="citation">Woolley, 2015</a>). Motivational messages can be helpful, but coupling them with resources can make the card even more effective for recipients.</p>

				<p>The 3x4 inch card could either be expanded to include more information, or the resources can be placed on the back. While some resources may be a given, it can be important to have them typed out for people to reference whenever they need to.</p>

				<p>Some of the resources that can be included are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>General resources</li>
					<li>Homelessness resources</li>
					<li>LGBTQ+ resources</li>
					<li>Mental health resources</li>
					<li>School resources</li>
				</ul>

				<p>There is a comprehensive list divided into different categories available on <a href="https://helphopehome.org/get-help/" target="_blank" class="citation">Help Hope Home</a>, an organisation aiming to end homelessness in Southern Nevada. There is also a list of resources from them available in a brochure format <a href="http://helphopehome.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Homeless-Resource-Guide-7.10.18.pdf" target="_blank" class="citation">here</a>. While this is an extensive list, one of each of the mentioned categories above would be beneficial for any recipient of the Project Dot kit.</p>

		</section>

		<section class="suggestions" id="three">
			<h1>suggestion three: social media</h1>
				<p>Social media is a huge part for any organisation that allows them to reach so many different people for little to nothing. It can help <strong>“engage supporters, capturing and retaining their attention,”</strong> and can <strong>increase awareness</strong> for the organisation (<a href="https://www.missionbox.com/article/118/why-social-media-matters-to-nonprofits" target="_blank" class="citation">MissionBox, 2020</a>). However, social media should be taken seriously and integrated with the marketing plan for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

				<p>According to MissionBox, a communication hub for nonprofits, a survey conducted among more than 9,000 small to medium-size nonprofits in the United States and Canada showed that Facebook is a primary social network for them, with Twitter next and other platforms like YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Instagram following behind (<a href="https://www.missionbox.com/article/118/why-social-media-matters-to-nonprofits" target="_blank" class="citation">MissionBox, 2020</a>). Social media can <strong>boost messages and establish relationships</strong> with partners to grow the organisation. Analytics can also inform you more about the audience you are reaching and make posts far more effective. In fact, for nonprofits, social media is growing 3x faster than email and should be used to announce what is happening and what is coming (<a href="https://buffer.com/library/social-media-non-profits/" target="_blank" class="citation">Lee</a>).</p>

				<p>Buffer has a <a href="https://buffer.com/library/social-media-non-profits/" target="_blank" class="citation">guide</a> for nonprofits looking to up their social media game, and it should be considered to see what works best for you!</p>

				<p>Project Dot should consider <strong>expanding the breadth of social media</strong> being used and make sure the accounts are linked to the main website. That way, all platforms are consolidated into one area and make it easier for anyone interested to access them.</p>

				<h2>Instagram</h2>
					<p><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Instagram</a></strong> would be a great platform to expand into. Wild Apricot, a site filled with resources for nonprofits, has a guide for using Instagram as a nonprofit that includes tips like making a business account (labeled as a nonprofit) and connecting your Instagram and Facebook accounts (<a href="https://www.wildapricot.com/blogs/newsblog/2019/09/17/instagram-for-nonprofits" target="_blank" class="citation">Morand, 2019</a>). Instagram is a great opportunity to post educational graphics, to educate followers and appeal to visual learners, and progress pictures, to let people know how you are doing and what you are doing. This allows you to <strong>connect with the community</strong> and <strong>reach a younger audience</strong>.</p>

					<div id="ig_photos">
						<img class="square_img" src="new_assets/media/ig_info.jpg" alt="info about ig professional accounts" draggable="false">

						<img class="square_img" src="new_assets/media/ig_steps.jpg" alt="info about ig professional accounts" draggable="false">
					
						<p class="caption">Professional account benefits and how to switch to a professional account</p>
					</div>

					<p>Instagram has the option to make your account a professional one. From there, it can be labeled as a 'Nonprofit,' and it provides insight to help grow the account.</p>

					<p>Personal photos are amazing, but if you're looking for other assets to complement, here are other resources for <strong>stock photos and photo editing:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Canva</a> — good for editing and can be used on desktop or mobile devices</li>
						<li><a href="https://stocksnap.io/" target="_blank" class="citation">StockSnap</a> — free stock photography</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Pexels</a> — free stock photography</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Twitter</h2>
					<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Twitter</a></strong> would also be a great platform for interacting with audiences. It does not hurt to have different platforms to reach different audiences, and Twitter can be good for having conversations within the community and learning from others. Advocacy-based organisations tend to do well on Twitter because it <strong>fosters discussion and debate</strong> (<a href="https://www.wildapricot.com/blogs/newsblog/2020/01/15/twitter-for-nonprofits#3" target="_blank" class="citation">Morand, 2020</a>). However, it works best when accounts engage with followers and replies to tweets, so if engagement is not something you want to be involved in on Twitter, then you could skip out on using it.</p> 

				<h2>TikTok</h2>
					<p><strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/" target="_blank" class="citation">TikTok</a></strong> can potentially be another platform for <strong>interacting with younger audiences</strong>. Although a late comer to the game, it has become one of the fastest growing platforms for teenagers. In 2019, 2% of U.S. teenagers aged 13-17 said TikTok is their most used social app (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-marketing-trends-predictions-2020" target="_blank" class="citation">Meola, 2019</a>). The advantage of TikTok is its ease to use. The content consists of 15~60 sec short videos. Content shooting and editing can easily be done over the phone as well. The disadvantage of TikTok is its policy on censorship and user privacy concerns. Many older generations have a rather negative attitude towards the app and may stop their kids from using it.</p> 

					<p>Despite the stigma surrounding the platform, TikTok can be used to cultivate relationships with younger audiences and spread awareness of the organisation’s campaign and message. It might be worth looking into.</p>

				<h2>Platform Management</h2>
					<p>However, with multiple platforms, social media scheduling is another aspect that should be considered. It allows people to be <strong>“active” online without actually being online</strong>, and you can <strong>bulk produce content</strong> and schedule them out to make it more convenient for your schedule (<a href="https://www.ignitesearch.com.au/social-media-scheduling-the-benefits-of-social-media-scheduling-and-why-you-should-start-scheduling-today/" target="_blank" class="citation">Barley, 2018</a>). Additionally, it allows you to manage different accounts.</p> 

					<p>Each platform depends on your taste, but <strong>try considering:</strong><p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" class="citation">Buffer</a></strong> — free basic plan but offers plans with more benefits like more accounts and more scheduled posts, pricing info <a href="https://buffer.com/pricing/publish" target="_blank" class="citation">here</a></li>

			<h1>suggestion four: logo</h1>
				<p>Logos are a part of <strong>brand identity</strong> and important to the overall perception of the organisation. It seems relatively simple and something you can create on your own or with free software, but logos are representative of your brand and something that should have a lot of thought put into. Having your logo designed by a graphic designer has a number of benefits, such as saving time and money (especially in the long run), helping you stand out amongst other organisations, and keeping your branding consistent (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-reasons-you-should-hire-professional-graphic-designer-rob-garza" target="_blank" class="citation">Garza, 2015</a>). Overall, having a professionally created logo is more helpful than not.</p>

				<p>The current Project Dot logo is simple and to the point, but if desired, hiring a graphic designer can <strong>elevate the logo</strong> and help <strong>establish a more concrete brand identity</strong>. Working with a graphic designer allows you to establish a relationship where they know your wants and needs and can specifically create a tailored design. If it is a local designer, it helps create connections within the community. Free logo makers are available, but having a graphic designer ensures that the design will be unique and catered to the brand. Additionally, this is an opportunity to establish design elements for the entire organisation that can be carried on into the future.</p>

				<p>Try looking at different local agencies’ portfolios to see if any of their work connects with what Project Dot stands for. There is also the option of looking for freelance graphic designers to commission and work with.</p> 

				<p>Logos may seem simple and unassuming, but crafting a logo that is visually appealing and effective is an art and a practice that should be recognised and valued as such.</p>

		<section class="suggestions" id="five">
			<h1>suggestion five: website</h1>
				<p>A website is a <strong>symbol of branding</strong> and a <strong>hub of information</strong> that can be used to reach audiences; it should be one of the most important aspects of your nonprofit. Project Dot’s website is simple and has the information, but it can be elevated to be more effective and efficient.</p>

				<p>It is important for websites to be <strong>accessible for any audience</strong>. Having a responsive website means ease of access no matter the device, whether it be a computer, tablet, or phone. All of the information should be available in one place to best inform users of the organisation’s mission.</p>

				<p>There are a variety of options to choose from when it comes to creating a website. Here are a selection of them, in alphabetical order, to explore and perhaps choose from:</p>

			<h1>suggestion six: donations</h1>
				<p>Donations are a pivotal part of any nonprofit organisation. However, it is not just about receiving donations but also donor cultivation. Donor cultivation is about <strong>engaging donors</strong> and learning about their feelings and perspectives on the organisation to <strong>encourage repeat donations</strong> (<a href="https://www.nonprofitpro.com/post/donor-cultivation-is-key-to-success/#:~:text=According%20to%20GiveGab%2C%20%E2%80%9CHow%20to,retaining%20and%20ensuring%20future%20donations." target="_blank" class="citation-dark">Haddad, 2018</a>). By communicating and engaging with donors, organisations are able to <strong>establish relationships</strong> that can be long lasting in supporting the cause.</p>

				<h2>PayPal</h2>

					<img src="new_assets/media/paypal.jpg" alt="paypal logo" draggable="false" id="paypal">
					<p class="caption">PayPal logo</p>

					<p>Project Dot currently uses <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">PayPal</a></strong> which is great for receiving donations directly on the platform. They charge 0% platform fees and 2.2% + $0.30 transaction fees for nonprofits with 501(c)(3) status and 2.9% + $0.30 for organisations without this status. More information is available <a href="https://www.paypal.com/charities/" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">here.</a></p> 

					<p>However, PayPal does not really target donors and establish relationships with them.</p>

				<h2>DonorBox</h2>

					<img src="new_assets/media/donorbox.jpg" alt="donorbox logo" draggable="false">
					<p class="caption">DonorBox logo and example</p>

					<p><strong><a href="https://donorbox.org/" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">DonorBox</a></strong> is an online donation tool that <strong>integrates donation forms</strong> into the website and <strong>helps cultivate donor engagement</strong>. They allow for social media integration and have other integrations like Company Gift Matching (for $40/month) and email marketing with Mail Chimp (for $8/month). It has a platform fee of 1.5% along with additional processing fees depending on what donors use to pay:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>0.8% + $0.30 per transaction for ACH bank payments (capped at a maximum of $5 per transaction)</li>
						<li>2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for PayPal payments</li>
						<ul class="sub">
							<li>2.2% + $0.30 if the organisation has 501(c)(3) status</li>
						</ul>
						<li>2.9% and $0.30 per transaction for Stripe payments</li>
						<ul class="sub">
							<li>Discounted rates available for nonprofits. More information <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/fee-discount-for-nonprofit-organizations" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">here.</a></li>
						</ul>
					</ul>

					<p>While PayPal is perfectly acceptable, Donorbox offers additional features that should be considered. Some of them include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Monthly, Annual, Weekly and Quarterly Recurring Donations</li>
						<li>Donors Cover Fees</li>
						<li>Collect Address, Phone, Employment</li>
						<li>Custom Donation Page</li>
						<li>Tax Receipt</li>
					</ul>

					<p>View a comparison of DonorBox vs. Paypal <a href="https://donorbox.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020559551-Donorbox-vs-PayPal-Which-Is-Better-Optimized-For-Fundraising-" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">here.</a></p>

				<p>Donations are an important part of funding nonprofits, and it should be given the same amount of consideration as the website and other marketing tools.</p>

			<h1>suggestion seven: out of home (OOH) marketing</h1>
				<p>Internet access is not something we consciously think about everyday but it is <strong>a luxury not everyone can afford</strong>. With the amount of menstruating homeless people there are in Las Vegas, not all of them have access to a cellular device or internet in general. Out-of-home (OOH) marketing would be beneficial as it <strong>can be seen via foot traffic</strong> and does not require internet or a third-party way of viewing.</p> 

				<p>OOH marketing has a variety of advantages and disadvantages. It has a <strong>wide coverage of local markets</strong> and the ability to <strong>create awareness</strong> (<a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/advertising-promotion-integrated-marketing-communications-perspective-belch-belch/M9781259548147.html" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">Belch & Belch, 2018</a>). Additionally, it allows organisations to <strong>be creative</strong> while being <strong>efficient and effective</strong> (<a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/advertising-promotion-integrated-marketing-communications-perspective-belch-belch/M9781259548147.html" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">Belch & Belch, 2018</a>). Unfortunately, OOH marketing does lead to <strong>waste coverage</strong> and can be <strong>hard to measure</strong> (<a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/advertising-promotion-integrated-marketing-communications-perspective-belch-belch/M9781259548147.html" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">Belch & Belch, 2018</a>). Ultimately, it is up to the organisation to determine if it is the best fit, but OOH marketing can be extremely <strong>beneficial for nonprofits</strong> who want to <strong>increase awareness about their cause.</strong> Especially for Project Dot, it can be useful for getting the message out there for the local community.</p>

				<p>OOH marketing is effective in delivering a message and driving traffic to the website when available. According to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, OOH advertising generates <strong>four times</strong> the rate of online activations than their relative ad spend (<a href="http://omac-website.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nielsen-OOH-Online-Activation-Study-2017.pdf" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">Williams, 2017</a>).</p> 

				<p>A few examples of OOH marketing that can be adopted are:</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Flyers posted in shelters, soup kitchens, gas stations, and nonprofit organizations or handed out in highly frequented areas</li>
					<ul> 
						<li>Flyers are cheaper to produce en masse and could be distributed directly to menstruating individuals for awareness or future reference</li>

					</ul> 
					<li>Lawn signs are seen almost everywhere, especially during election season (road side, close to schools, or on neighborhood lawns)</li> 
					<ul>
						<li>Visible and can be posted anywhere that is highly frequented by homeless and disadvantaged people</li>

			<h1>suggestion eight: partnerships</h1>
				<p>Partnerships with other organisations is a great way to expand nonprofits. By working with appropriate organisations, such as schools or churches, nonprofits can <strong>broaden their reach</strong> and get their message out to the community to <strong>increase engagement</strong> (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2020/05/19/six-big-benefits-nonprofits-can-gain-from-for-profit-partnerships/#795075c32a8b" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">Council, 2020</a>). Word of mouth can also go a long way towards reaching a wider audience, and this leads to an increase in brand recognition within the community. Partnerships give nonprofits the opportunity to appeal to more people who are willing to advocate for their mission and who may want to volunteer and help (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2020/05/19/six-big-benefits-nonprofits-can-gain-from-for-profit-partnerships/#795075c32a8b" target="_blank" class="citation-dark">Council, 2020</a>). This means more resources and help to accomplish the mission.</p>

				<p>Project Dot could reach out to schools in CCSD and even higher education institutions to spread the word about period poverty. When learning about puberty and sex education, it may be helpful for educators to also provide resources with the help of Project Dot. This can also establish a partnership with the district and give the organisation a larger platform. Additionally, Project Dot could consider hanging up flyers on campuses for people to see and potentially learn more from; it can also <strong>help those in need</strong> who were not aware before. Project Dot can even be a volunteering option for students who are looking to get more involved as they could help create kits. Partnering with local churches can expand the reach through communities across the city. With greater outreach, <strong>period poverty can be destigmatised</strong>, and Project Dot can reach more people who need help.</p> 

				<p>Even if partnerships do not work out, it could still be beneficial to make Project Dot <strong>known as a resource and option</strong>. Spreading the word to influential organisations throughout Las Vegas will also expand Project Dot’s reach and platform.</p>
