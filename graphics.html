The mountains and sun would represent the natural aspects of the state and the casino chip border would help tie in an important aspect of Nevada. It gave me a new perspective on design and what it would be like designing for different mediums. I used Adobe Illustrator to create this design.</p>

The competition had four main challenges: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and design. The competition was done in partners and the work was divided and shared. I was in charge of the design challenge that asked for a mockup of a website for a Mexican-German fusion restaurant. </p> 
							<p class="desc"> My inspiration for the mockup was the colors of the Mexican and German flag. I encorporated the two countries' colors and tried to create a visually appealing homepage. The fonts were chosen to be easily read and the slide show would provide interaction between the user and the page. I used Adobe Illustrator to create this mockup. It was interesting to work under a small time constraint and see where the design would go.</p>
